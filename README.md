## Summary
This is my solution for the web service coding challenge

Built using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [mongoDB](https://mongodb.com/)

This service would allow a front-end application to create, read, update, and delete customer 
data from a cloud database (MongoDB Atlas). Operations such as reading, updating, and deleting
are dependent on the id value associated with a particular customer.
